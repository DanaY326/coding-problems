These are two samples of how to "justify" your solutions.

There is no exact syntax... just provide a brief explanation of how you arrived at your answer.

1) 
time: O(n^3)
justification:
Let n be the length of the array.
Inner Loop: Sum[j=i..n]:O(n)
            = O(n^2)
Outer Loop: Sum[i=1..n]:O(1)
            = O(n)

2) 
time: O(n)
justification:
Let n be the length of the array
T(n) = O(1) + T(n - 1)
     = O(n)

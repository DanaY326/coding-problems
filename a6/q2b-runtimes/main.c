// For this question, you will do runtime analysis on various functions. 
// Place your answers to the questions in a file runtimes.txt. 
// See the provided sample.txt for formatting suggestions.
// (the functions you need to analyze are on Edx - A06 Q02b)

// This main file is just so that running 'make submit' will work 
// Since this question will be handmarked, 'make test' will not do anything 
// DO NOT CHANGE THIS MAIN.C, your only changes should be in runtimes.txt
